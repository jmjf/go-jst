# Phase 1 -- Job Status -- Work backlog

I have a few items in `999-Backlog.md` to do before I call Phase 1 done.

## When testing with DbSqlPgx, ensure WithArgs() checks argument order

Because I'm using a database library that requires met to write SQL statements and pass arguments manually, SQL argument order is critical to ensure good data.

I want my test database mocks to check argument order so I'm sure the data that will be sent to the database is correct (don't cross column values).

First, I need a time matcher for `sqlmock`. They suggest a basic matcher that accepts anything, but I'll build something slightly more sophisticated. This code is in `jobStatus/useCases_test.go` but probably belongs in a testing utility space.

```golang
type matchTime struct {
  t time.Time
}

func (mt matchTime) Match(v driver.Value) bool {
  v1, ok := v.(time.Time)
  if ok && v1.Compare(mt.t) == 0 {
    return true
  }
  return false
}

// Then in WithArgs

  .WithArgs(matchTime{t: timeToMatch })
```

In `beforeEach()`, I truncate `JobTs` to seconds because it looks like that's happening in `sqlmock` somewhere, so having nanoseconds won't match.

Now, I need a `Match()` on my `Date` type. I considered putting this on the `Date` itself, but decided `Match` is a very generic name. So, I use `matchTime{t: time.Time(dto.BusDt)}`, because `Date` is just a new type of `time.Time`.

**COMMIT:** TEST: use WithArgs() in database tests to ensure parameters are passed correctly

## Pointer receivers vs. value receivers

When attaching methods to a `struct`, the receiver can be a pointer or value. Pointer receivers allow changing the instance referenced. Value receivers work on a copy.

```golang
type MyType struct{
  s string
}

// pointer receiver
func (mt *MyType) SetSPtr(str string) {
  mt.s = str
}

// value receiver
func (mt MyType) SetSVal(str string) MyType {
  mt.s = str
  return mt
}

func main() {
 v := MyType{s: "hello"}
 v.SetSVal("world1")
 fmt.Printf("%+v\n", v)

 v2 := v.SetSVal("world2a")
 fmt.Printf("%+v || %+v\n", v, v2)

 v = v.SetSVal("world2b")
 fmt.Printf("%+v\n", v)

 v.SetSPtr("world3")
 fmt.Printf("%+v\n", v)

 (&v).SetSPtr("world4")
 fmt.Printf("%+v\n", v)
}

/*** OUTPUT
{s:hello}
{s:hello} || {s:world2a}
{s:world2b}
{s:world3}
{s:world4}
***/
```

The compiler does some automatic conversions between pointers and values that work in some cases, but not others (interfaces). Common wisdom is to pick one and use it consistently for a given `struct` type, especially if an interface is in play. Many people lean toward pointers to have a common pattern everywhere.

My general preference is to avoid mutation, so I favor a strategy like the "world2a" and "world2b" examples above (explicitly overwrite). Unexpected mutation is a risk.

Golang does automatic conversions to/from pointers, so I might not know a function is mutating a value unless the function makes it explicit. I expect a setter to mutate and a getter not to mutate. Other functions may be unclear unless I explicitly passes a pointer (`someFunc(&mutateMe)` or `(&mutateMe).someFunc()`). Maybe an easy risk reduction is documentation comments and a consistent statement about whether a function mutates or not.

If the `struct` includes a synchronizing field (`sync.Mutex` or similar), methods must use a pointer receiver because copying the mutex breaks it. For `map`, `func`, `chan`, and slice, value receivers seem to be preferred. These type are the 1x - 3x the size of a pointer, so passing a pointer gets little gain and adds indirection. Small types (`int`, `rune`, etc.) fall into the same space as do small `structs`.

I also read a well reasoned article arguing against passing pointers seeking to avoid the cost of data copying. In modern CPU architectures, parameters passed by value are likely to be in L1/L2/L3 cache. Pointer parameters are more likely to require falling out to RAM, which is slower. The receiver is effectively another parameter to the function so behaves the same. Either decision seems like an optimization choice (value -> in cache -> better performance vs. pointer -> avoid copy -> better performance). There's a tradeoff and the correct answer is, "It depends."

I want to check all interfaces and methods that take a receiver and make them consistent so behavior is predictable, making decisions based on sound understanding of what they need to do.

I want to ensure all methods and interfaces have documentation comments that include a statement about whether a function mutates the receiver or not.

Let's go through file by file starting with `jobStatus`.

* `common.go` -- has no receivers
* `ctrlServeHttp.go` -- has one receiver; no mutation, added doc comments
* `domain.go` -- has no receivers
* `dto.go` -- has receivers; two do not mutate, added doc comments
  * `normalizeTimes` did mutate, now I have in `common/utils.go` a function `common.TruncateTimeToMs(tm time.Time) time.Time`.
* `repoDbSqlPgx.go` -- has receivers; no mutation, added doc comments
* `repoMemory.go` -- has receivers; all mutate the mutex, one mutates data, added doc comments
* `usesCases_test.go` -- has receivers; on `matchDate`, does not mutate, not adding comments because it's used for tests only
* `useCases.go` -- has receivers; none mutate (two are TODO items, but won't mutate), added doc comments

Next `common`.

* `date_test.go` -- has no receivers
* `date.go` -- has receivers; one mutates (`UnmarshalJSON()`, must mutate), added doc comments
* `errors.go` -- has receivers; none mutate, added doc comments
* `utils.go` -- has no receivers

And `cmd/httpServer`, where `main.go` has one receiver. It doesn't mutate and I'm going to ignore it for now because I expect changes in the near future, so will deal with it then. I'm ignoring `cmd/testRepo` because it's a one-off test program that requires changes to base code to work--not production.

I've ended up with a mix of pointer and value receivers, but I think that's legitimate. Only the memory repo (mainly for testing/demo) and `date.go`'s `UnmarshalJSON()`, whose interface I can't control, mutate. Doc comments call out which methods mutate so mutation isn't hidden or accidental.

**COMMIT:** CHORE: apply pointer receivers vs. value receivers based on mutation; note mutation behavior in doc comments

**COMMIT:** CHORE: reorg code in jobStatus a bit (probably more to come)

## Build a repo with gorm, split testing for different repo types

* Consider writing a `gormRepo` that uses `gorm`.
  * It's an ORM that seems to have key features I'd want, but needs more investigation.
