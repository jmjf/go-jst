# Interlude -- Reorganize server setup and startup

## Move repos up one level

Repos are in `jobStatus/db/*/repo.go`. I want to remove the `db` layer and prefix `*` with `db` so they're grouped and easier to get to.

* Move directories and renamed.
* Change test import paths. Tests pass.
* Change `cmd` import paths. Run `database/sql`/`pgx`, responses and logs as expected.

**COMMIT:** REFACTOR: move repos up one layer
