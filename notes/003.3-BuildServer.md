# Interlude -- Reorganize server setup and startup

## Move repos up one level

Repos are in `jobStatus/db/*/repo.go`. I want to remove the `db` layer and prefix `*` with `db` so they're grouped and easier to get to.

* Move directories and renamed.
* Change test import paths. Tests pass.
* Change `cmd` import paths. Run `database/sql`/`pgx`, responses and logs as expected.

**COMMIT:** REFACTOR: move repos up one layer

I want to make the repo `New*()` methods generic so I can use the same call regardless of the repo I select.

* Change repo object to `repoDb` in all repos
* Change repo `New*()` to `NewRepoDb()`; change references in all repos
* Change test import paths. Tests pass.
* Change `cmd` import paths. Run `dbSqlPgx`, responses and logs as expected.
